                    <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It
                        moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
                        world once and got a taste for murder. After the
                        avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&#39;t
                        know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know
                        that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
                        made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#39;m breaking now.
                        We said we&#39;d say it was the snow that killed the other
                        two, but it wasn&#39;t. Nature is lethal but it doesn&#39;t hold
                        a candle to man.</p>
                    <h3>How we work</h3>
                    <p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great
                        place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
                        then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his
                        world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world
                        where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#39;s Cesar&#39;s
                        world, and if you&#39;re not willing to play by his rules,
                        then you&#39;re gonna have to pay the price. </p>
                </div>

                    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a
                        slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name
                        printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a
                        blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
                        mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters
                        in it? No? Well, that&#39;s what you see at a toy store. And
                        you must think you&#39;re in a toy store, because you&#39;re
                        here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

                    <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
                        by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
                        men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good
                        will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
                        for he is truly his brother&#39;s keeper and the finder of
                        lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with
                        great vengeance and furious anger those who would
                        attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will
                        know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon
                        thee.</p>
                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I&#39;m
                        not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
                        how you can tell who the arch-villain&#39;s going to be?
                        He&#39;s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times
                        they&#39;re friends, like you and me! I should&#39;ve known way
                        back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids.
                        They called me Mr Glass. </p>

                    <p>You see? It&#39;s curious. Ted did figure it out - time
                        travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone.
                        How it&#39;s possible, how it&#39;s done, what the dangers are.
                        But then why fifty years in the future when the
                        spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer
                        call it an &#39;unknown entry event&#39;? Why don&#39;t they know?
                        If they don&#39;t know, that means we never told anyone. And
                        if we never told anyone it means we never made it back.
                        Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive
                        logic.</p>

                    <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show.
                        That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to
                        the people who make shows, and on the strength of that
                        one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more
                        shows. Some pilots get picked and become television
                        programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one
                        of the ones that became nothing. </p>
